# Industrial Hemp Information Hub: Project Planning

## Project Vision
To create a comprehensive, easily navigable platform that serves as the definitive resource for industrial hemp information. The database will cater to researchers, businesses, consumers, policymakers, and other stakeholders in the hemp industry.

## Architecture Overview

### Information Architecture
Based on the comprehensive data provided, we'll implement a multi-faceted categorization system:

1. **Plant Part-Based Classification**
   - Bast Fiber
   - Hurd/Shiv
   - Seeds (Whole, Oil, Flour, Protein, Meal)
   - Cannabinoids (CBD, Minor Cannabinoids)
   - Terpenes
   - Biomass (Flowers/Leaves/Stems)
   - Roots
   - Advanced Materials (Nanomaterials, Carbon/Graphene)
   - Bioplastics/Composites

2. **Industry/Application-Based Classification**
   - Textiles & Fashion
   - Construction & Building Materials
   - Automotive
   - Paper Industry
   - Food & Beverages
   - Pharmaceuticals & Nutraceuticals
   - Cosmetics & Personal Care
   - Energy Solutions
   - Environmental & Agricultural Applications
   - Animal Nutrition & Care
   - Advanced Materials & Applications

3. **Interconnected Branches & Nodes System**
   - Visual representation showing relationships between plant parts and end uses

### Database Schema (High-Level)
1. **Products & Applications**
   - ID, Name, Description
   - Plant Part(s) Used (foreign key)
   - Industry Categories (many-to-many)
   - Properties & Benefits
   - Commercialization Stage
   - Manufacturing Process Notes
   - Technical Specifications
   - Sustainability Metrics
   - Image/Media Links

2. **Companies**
   - ID, Name, Website, Location(s)
   - Company Type/Activities (multiple)
   - Products/Services Offered
   - Notes

3. **Regulatory Information**
   - Jurisdiction
   - THC Limits
   - Licensing Requirements
   - Permitted/Prohibited Uses
   - Import/Export Regulations
   - Effective Date
   - References/Links

4. **Research**
   - Study Title, Authors
   - Publication Details
   - Focus Area
   - Key Findings
   - Link to Paper/Patent

5. **Historical Data**
   - Time Period
   - Event/Development
   - Significance
   - References

## Technical Stack

# Industrial Hemp Information Hub: Tasks

## âœ… Recently Completed (May 2025)

### Database Alignment & Migration
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Analyzed live Supabase database vs GitHub repository
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Identified schema discrepancy (live DB uses `categories` & `products`, not `plant_types`)
- [x] Created updated migration file reflecting actual live database structure
- [x] Documented current database with 12 categories and 39+ products

### Frontend Architecture Updates
- [x] Updated all TypeScript types to match live database schema
- [x] Created comprehensive API service layer (`src/lib/api.ts`)
- [x] Built React hooks for data fetching (`src/hooks/useApi.ts`)
- [x] Updated Supabase client configuration
- [x] Added TypeScript type generation script

### Page Development
- [x] **HomePage**: Complete with live data integration
- [x] **CategoriesPage**: Replaces old PlantTypesPage, uses correct schema
- [x] **CategoryDetailPage**: Shows category details with products
- [x] **ProductDetailPage**: Individual product view with related products
- [x] **AboutPage**: Comprehensive project information
- [x] **ResearchPage**: Placeholder for future research database
- [x] **ResearchDetailPage**: Individual research paper view (placeholder)

### Components & Infrastructure
- [x] **Layout**: Header, navigation, footer with responsive design
- [x] **ErrorBoundary**: Comprehensive error handling
- [x] **QueryClient**: Optimized React Query configuration
- [x] Updated routing to use correct database structure

### Documentation & Configuration
- [x] **README**: Updated to reflect current project state
- [x] **package.json**: Added type generation and Supabase CLI
- [x] **Migration files**: Current database schema documented
